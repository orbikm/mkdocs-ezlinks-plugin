* Fixes path searching on Windows machines ([`b147d5f`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/b147d5f33dd937e34a28a0e0f40b58dd43b5d9f3))

* Add support for Reference Link definitions (#32)

* Addresses Github Issue #31, which is a feature request for supporting
  Reference Link format links. ([`c4deab4`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/c4deab447beb482da4897a7986ce99f10e4cf0f3))

* Release 0.12.0 (#30)

* Fixes issue #25, `Absolute links not using http:// or https:// are treated as relative`.

* Fixes issue #27, `Dictionary file cache is not being leveraged`. ([`bee614f`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/bee614f08b3c2d8684231f714d6bf9b1c59832bf))

* Fix fast file cache reduction (#29)

* Previously, an attempt was made to speed up the most naive case of
  EzLink conversion, where there is a unique filename across the entire
  site. This would allow a simple dictionary lookup instead of a full
  Prefix Trie search (which is more expensive).

  Previously, it incorrectly trimmed _all_ files from the file cache
  when reducing it to unique items, because the dictionary comprehension
  had an inverted comparison operator.

  Now, unique file names will be directly converted via the fast file
  cache. ([`66a508d`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/66a508d53958c8a1261f7a44be6ff44b036a452d))

* Treat any link containing protocol scheme as ext (#28)

* This expands the existing behavior of ignoring `http://` and `https://`
  schemes (which _were_ hardcoded into the regex) with a greedier Regex
  that rejects any link that contains any valid protocol scheme in the
  link.

  A big thanks to @robbcrg for the bug report as well as a proof of concept
  PR! ([`1e63c84`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/1e63c84f346432dd41745eaf3442cbc02c42fc8c))

* Release 0.1.11 (#23)

* Prevent direct links from searching for file

* In the change from a dictionary lookup to a trie search
  method, it broke direct linking in a subtle way. The links
  would ultimately be rendered correctly, however, it required
  even direct links to go through the file search process, which
  made things less efficient than it should be.

  Now, direct links are detected &amp; applied directly.

* Improved efficiency of the searching algorithm, leveraging
  a direct file name lookup in a dictionary for files that
  have a unique name across the site. This should prevent
  the less efficient, disambiguating trie search in the naive
  case where there are unique files. ([`c924471`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/c924471192bee0cdb996d6585fa52bb05bd7e182))

* Fix functional relative links and add auto-disambiguation

Implement auto-disambiguation and bugfix
    
    * This fixes a bug in the previous search strategy that missed
      allowing for local relative links (something like index.md
      referring to about.md in the same subdirectory).
    
    * It also adds a bit further auto-disambiguation. By this,
      I mean it will attempt to find the _closest_ match in proximity
      (with respect to the folder hierarchy). For instance,
      if this is the layout:
    
      ```
      + guide/
        + test.md
        + getting_started/
            + index.md
      + tutorials/
        - test.md
        + getting_started/
           + index.md
        + more_advanced/
           + index.md
      ```
      If you placed a link inside `guide/getting_started/index.md`
      such as `[Test](test)`, the resulting link has ambiguity, but
      in the default case, the `guide/test.md` file is _closer_ than
      the `tutorials/test.md`, therefore, it will select that file.
    
      You can still further disambiguate the link if desired, but
      this provides a bit more sane defaults. ([`66c05f4`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/66c05f49d4216cab0edf38c53d583f31b8fdf816))

* [release-0.1.9] Support EzLink path-component based disambiguation (#20)

* Update file searching to support partial paths

* This feature switches from using a dictionary to a prefix
  trie, caching the files in reverse order (path wise),
  which allows for:

 ```
 + folder1/
      - index.md
 + folder2/
      - index.md
 ```

You can now link to `folder1/index.md` and `folder2/index.md`, or
`folder1/index` and `folder2/index`. This allows disambiguating
duplicate filenames from separate unique paths.

This works across all link types supported by EzLinks.

Resolves: #18

* Finishing touches

* Adds a number of additional test links, which leverage both
  link types.

* Add documentation on the new feature.

* Adds a configuration option to control whether EzLinks warns
  or simply prints a debug log message when it encounters link
  ambiguities. ([`249c838`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/249c83856d24f5af4b121b057716ce80a44fe200))

* Bump version number ([`61ba1b4`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/61ba1b48cf77dcaa67b2bfdc1419106adf41e602))

* Fixes issue with multiple links on a single line (#17)

* If there was more than a single MD link on a single line in
  a page, the Regex would capture too aggressively, ending up
  with a broken capture

* Adds some tests for single line with multiple links

Resolves: #16 ([`6aee4f8`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/6aee4f8abccce4266a45b07966e7f432f496c7a1))

* Bump version number ([`dc11350`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/dc113503ebc4f5b9dd4ca3c6b2899f18e4f37b5c))

* Fix compat with python 3.6 (#15)

Fixes a couple of language constructs that did not exist in Python 3.6, which is the advertised minspec for this project. I have now made the fixes required to work using Python 3.6.

Resolves: #14 ([`3f46e7e`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/3f46e7eb111327ac0bb2c4bd79c3fdb528fee02d))

* Update release version ([`435a250`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/435a25010a83ca02b39a9b90b97ca35bd19d8958))

* Bugfix/issue 12 (#13)

Various fixes spawing from issues reported in #12

* Do not scan external links with an http:// or https:// prefix,
  which will prevent properly formatted external links from
  emitting a warning for a missing link target.

* Includes an __init__.py for the mkdocs_ezlinks_plugin/scanners
  module, which then is included into the distribution.

* Also downgrades some prior warnings to debug level,
  as most of the messages trigger existing mkdocs warnings
  (such as broken link warnings, etc.)

* Messages are now automatically filtered based on the
  &#39;--quiet&#39; and &#39;--verbose&#39; mkdocs flags.

* Update `Configuration Options` in README.md ([`7297d10`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/7297d10b9c3f7e193c344150ec59c19fa84f03e4))

* Bump version number (#11) ([`c86ac23`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/c86ac23ad452893b5c81f26e7f4383dd15008739))

* Significant refactor (#10)

* Significant refactor

This change aims to extract the major components from the plugin
file, and into more modular, single responsibility classes.

* Introduces the FileMapper, which provides an interface for building
  the file name lookup, as well as searching for said mapped files

* Introduces the EzLinksReplacer, which was all non-mkdoc specific
   functionality from plugin.py

* Introduces a link scanner pattern, a simple chain of responsibility
  for matching a link pattern, and extracting the links from that
  link type

* All link patterns generate the same link information, which allows
  all link types to funnel through the same processing, regardless of
  how they were extracted.

* Also removes the &#39;absolute&#39; option, as I believe it should always be
  true.

* Update README

* Few bugfixes

* Remove absolute option from EzLinksOptions

* Fix WikiLink scanning:
  Allow an empty link target if an anchor is specified (similar to
  an md link without a target, but with an anchor. This allows for
  valid in-page linking (based on section headings) ([`5da1551`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/5da1551cb70f333c9aa028ba7f8ee9ecc73414a8))

* Preserve code blocks (#8)

* Don&#39;t scan any link patterns inside of fence blocks, both inline, and multiline.

* Refactor the regex patterns to leverage the
re.X (verbose) flag, which ignores whitespace within the pattern.

* Various PEP-8 formatting fixes (though not all!) ([`10e2b21`](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/mkdocs-ezlinked-plugin/commit/10e2b21ac2b243726422f88e70c1ef1f4391a718))
